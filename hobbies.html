            <h1>My hobby is cycling</h1>
            <p class="info">
                
            I really enjoy cycling. I started riding a bike late, at the age of 15, and quickly began practicing this sport regularly. 
            I had several accidents, and one of the funniest was when I crashed into a post and split my lip from the impact. I also had serious accidents, 
            but I believe thats part of the sport, and those mistakes help you become better every day.

                I competed twice in cycling championships. I loved it so much that I started going out every day at 6 AM to practice,
                 always wanting to improve my times, aiming to complete the same route in less time each day. I began meeting people and
                  discovered various places in Arequipa thanks to cycling. My longest ride was 60 kilometers. I went to reconnoiter a 
                  competition in Uchumayo from my house, round trip.
